# Meta-Learning
1. <<filename>> is meta-leaning training with finetune on new dataset on OFDM channel in autoencoder structure (main component is resnet).
2. <<filename>> is joint training with finetune with finetune on new dataset and learn from scratch on OFDM channel in autoencoder structure.
3. <<filename>> is meta-leaning on RCAN net with finetune with compare to joint learning with finetune on new dataset and learn from scratch.
